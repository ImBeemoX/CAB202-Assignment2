# CAB202-Assignment2
This is a sample code of QUT CAB202 Assignment2 19sem1

I hope this will be useful for future students who are struggling with this assignment :)

You will be needing those following libraries to compile main.c:

usb_serial

cab202_adc

cab202_teensy

OR you can simply use the main.hex which is already compiled

Love,
